\begin{problem}
\item A restaurant would like to test a new menu item. They estimate
  that the cost for producing $x$ servings in market A is 12\$ per
  serving. They estimate that the cost for producing $y$ servings in
  market B is \$15 per serving.  They will allocate a total of
  \$36,000 for producing the total number of servings. Write out an
  expression that relates the cost to the number of servings produced
  in market A and market B.  
  \vfill
\item The number of mosquitoes per acre in an area is estimated to be
  600 times the area of open water measured in acres. The area of open
  water in a location is declining over time and is
  $A(t)=50-\frac{1}{3}t$, where $t$ is the number of years since
  January 1 of the current year. Determine the number of mosquitoes
  per acre in terms of $t$.
  \vfill
\item The delay time required for a neuron to recharge is estimate to
  be a function of the calcium concentration,
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathrm{Recharge([Ca])} & = & 0.05-\mathrm{[Ca]}^2.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  The concentration of calcium in an experiment is changed over time
  and is estimated to be 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathrm{[Ca]}(t) & = & 0.01+\frac{1}{1+t}.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Determine the formula used to estimate the recharge delay as a
  function of time, $t$. \textit{(Do not simplify the expression.)}
