\item If a 15 ft ladder is leaning against a wall at an angle of $62^\circ$ with the ground, how high up the will will the ladder reach?  Round to the nearest tenth of a foot.\vfill

\item A 30 ft boat ramp makes a $7^\circ$ angle with the water.  What is the height of the ramp above the water at the ramp's highest point?  Round to the nearest tenth of a foot.\vfill

\item At a tree farm, palm trees are harvested once they reach a height of 20 feet.  Suppose a farm worker determine's that the distance along the ground from her position to the base of a palm tree is 22 feet.  She then uses an instrument called a clinometer held at her eye level of 6 feet to measure the angle of elevation tot he top of the tree as $30.2^\circ$.  Is the tree tall enough to harvest?\vfill
