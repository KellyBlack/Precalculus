Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
---------------------------------------

Goals for activity 10 (Section 3.2 of the book)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Students should be able to do each of the following:

* Use the definition of an exponential function to define a function describing a situation given in written, verbal, or graphical form.

* Use the properties and operations of exponential functions to solve for any variable in an expression that has exponential functions.

* Be able to graph exponential functions. Be able to compare and identify different exponential functions whose parameters differ.
    
* Convert and write any exponential function using base $e$.
  
* Solve compound interest problems given a written description of the situation.
    
* Solve exponential growth/decay problems given a written description of the situation. Be able to identify if a situation results in either growth or decay.
    
* Given a written description determine if an exponential function or a logistic growth function is appropriate.
