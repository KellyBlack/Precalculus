\begin{problem}
\item A developer has a square plot of land that is 100 meters by 100
  meters that is next to a river. The land will be divided into two
  parts by making a rectangle in one corner of the large plot with its
  width along the river. The height of the rectangle will be ten
  meters shorter than its width. It is estimated that the rectangular
  plot of land will sell for \$2.00 per square meter plus 100\$/meter
  times the width, and the remaining land will sell for \$4.00 per
  square meter.  Determine the dimensions of the rectangular plot that
  will result in the highest profit.
  \begin{subproblem}
    \item Make a sketch of the situation.
      \vfill
    \item Within the sketch above, identify and label the variables
      that you will use.
    \item Determine any relevant relationships between your variables
      and the total cost of the land.
    \item How will you solve this problem?
      \vfill
    \item Determine the dimensions of the rectangular plot that will
      result in the highest profit.
      \sideNote{Check your work and make sure that you maximized the
        profit and did not minimize it.}

\item A traffic engineer observes the movement of traffic on a busy
  street. She estimates that when the traffic density is 0 cars/meter
  that the rate of flow is 0 cars/minute. She notices that when the
  density is high, roughly 0.1 cars/meter or more, there is gridlock,
  and the rate of flow is 0 cars/minute. Finally, she notices that
  when there is 0.05 cars per meter the rate of flow is at a maximum
  of 20 cars per minute.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Assuming that the rate of flow is 0 if the density is greater
    than 0.1 make a rough sketch of the rate of flow as a function of
    the density below.  
    \vfill
  \item Assuming that the rate of flow is a quadratic function of the
    traffic density when the density is between 0 and 0.1 cars/meter
    inclusive, determine the formula for the traffic density.

\item Two super hero capes will be sewn as part of a
  demonstration. One cape will be in the shape of a square. The other
  cape will be in the shape of a triangle, and the height is the same
  length as the base. They will be displayed together, and the sum of
  the two lengths must be 6 feet. What are the dimensions of the capes
  that will minimize the total area of the capes?
