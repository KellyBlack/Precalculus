\begin{problem}
\item Mark the points $P_1(-2,-4)$ and $P_2(4,1)$ on the axes
  below. Determine the distance between the two points.  Include a
  sketch of a right triangle whose hypotenuse represents the distance
  between the two points.

\item Mark the point $P_3(1,-2)$ on the axes below. Determine the
  points on the $x$-axis that are a distance of 3 units from $P_3$.
  \sideNote{Write out the distance formula for the points on the
    $x$-axis and solve for the unknown variable.} Mark the points on
  the axes below.
