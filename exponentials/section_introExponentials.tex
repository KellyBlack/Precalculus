\item A bank offers 1.5\% annual interest compounded weekly (assume 52

  two years. How much money should you deposit?

\propertiesTitle{Properties of Exponential Functions}

Exponential functions are used whenever some quantity has a
proportional increase over fixed time spans. An example is a
bacteria population that increases by 100\% every six hours. That
means that every six hours the population doubles. In the diagram
below, a single bacteria starts in a sample. After the first time
period, six hours, there are two bacteria. After another six hours,
a total of 12 hours, there are four bacteria.
In each six hour time period that follows the population doubles.

Exponential functions satisfy the algebraic properties given below. In
each example it is assumed that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, and
$a>0$.
\begin{eqnarray}
  a^b \cdot a^c & = & a^{b+c}   \\ [10pt]
  \frac{a^b}{a^c} & = & a^{b-c} \\  [10pt]
  \left( a^b \right)^c & = & a^{b\cdot c}
\end{eqnarray}

Also, $e$ is a constant number, and we define the number $e$ to be
\begin{eqnarray*}
  e & \approx & 2.718.
\end{eqnarray*}

It is common to use the number $e$ as the base for exponentials. The
number $e$ plays the same role as the constant $a$ in the equations
above:
\begin{eqnarray}
  e^b \cdot e^c & = & e^{b+c}   \\ [10pt]
  \frac{e^b}{e^c} & = & e^{b-c} \\  [10pt]
  \left( e^b \right)^c & = & e^{b\cdot c}
\end{eqnarray}
