\preClass{Coordinate Systems}



\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 3.6 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that \$50,000 from a retirement account is invested in a large cap stock fund.  After 20 years, the value is \$194,809.67.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the model $A=Pe^{rt}$ to determine the average rate of return under continuous compounding. (Do not simplify or round your answer.)
\vfill
\item  Assuming interest continues to accumulate at this average rate, how long will it take the investment to reach \$250,000?  Round your final answer to the nearest tenth of a year.

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item  A sample from a mummified bull was taken from a pyramid in Dashur, Egypt.  The sample shows that 78\% of the carbon-14 still remains.  How old is the sample?  Round to the nearest year.  Use the model $Q(t)=Q_0e^{-0.000121t}$ for radiocarbon dating.



\end{enumerate}
