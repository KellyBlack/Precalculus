\preClass{Coordinate Systems}



\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 5.1 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Simplify the expression.  Write the final form with no fractions or products.
$$\cos(x)\tan(x)\csc(x)$$

\vfill

\item Verify the trigonometric identities and \textbf{write the name of the fundamental identity used at each step}. Remember to only manipulate one side.  The other side should stay the same.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  $\sin(-x)+\csc(x)=\cot(x)\cos(x)$\vfill
\vfill
\vfill


\newpage
\item  $\displaystyle \frac{\sin^2(x)+1}{\cos^2(x)}+1=2\sec^2(x)$\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
