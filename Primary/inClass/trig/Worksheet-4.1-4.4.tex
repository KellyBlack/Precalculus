\item A ship is anchored a distance of $d=150$ from a beach.  A spotlight on the bow of the ship can rotate, and the angle is measured from a line perpendicular to the beach that goes through the base of the spotlight.  Determine the position, $y$, along the beach that the spotlight will illuminate the given angle, $\theta$.  (Your answer should be a function of $\theta$ with $-\pi/2<\theta <\pi/2.)$\\

\item Two observers are standing a distance of 100m apart.  They both spot an eagle and watch it closely.  The moment it passes between them, the first observer measures an angle of elevation from the ground of $45^\circ$, and the second observer measures an angle of elevation from the ground of $35^\circ.$  How high in the air was the eagle when it passed between the two observers?\vfill
