\begin{problem}
\item When viewed above the north pole of the Sun, the earth appears
  to move around the sun in a counter-clockwise direction. The path
  can be roughly approximated as a circle. It takes
  one year to make one revolution, and assume that the distance from
  the center of the sun to the earth is one solar unit.

  \item What distance does the earth traverse in one year?

  \item What distance does the earth traverse in two years?

  \item What distance does the earth traverse in ten years?
    \vfill
  \item Assume that the eastern direction is to the right, and the
    northern direction is up. What is the furthest East that the earth
    moves? What is the furthest West, North, and South that the earth
    moves?

\item At the annual Plainfield $500\pi$ race a car will make 250 laps
  around a circular track. The track has a radius of 1 km. A single
  car will make a trial run by going around the track at 1 km per
  hour. (It is not a very fast race.) The car starts on the point
  furthest East and is initially moving to the North.

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item How far will the car travel in all? Determine the distance
    traveled as a function of time, and then determine the angle,
    $\theta$, at any time.
    \vfill
  \item Assuming that the origin is the center of the track, sketch a
    plot of the car's $y$ position as a function of time for the
    first two laps.
