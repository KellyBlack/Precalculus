\preClass{Coordinate Systems}



\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 1.4 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Determine a \emph{point-slope} equation for a line through $(-5,2)$ and $(6,-3)$.

\vfill
\item Write the \emph{slope-intercept} equation for a line through the point $(2,3)$ that is perpendicular to the line $2x+4y-7=0$.

\vfill


\item Given the function defined $f(x)=x^2+3$, determine the average rate of change of $f(x)$ from $x_1=2$ to $x_2=4$.
\vfill

\end{enumerate}
