  \begin{subproblem}
  \item First focus on the left hand side of the equation.
    \begin{subsubproblem}
    \item Define a new variable, $u$, by setting $u$ equal to the left
      hand side of the equation.
      \vspace{1em}
    \item Exponentiate both sides of the equation using a clever
      choice for the base so that there will not be any logarithms in
      the equation. Simplify the result.
      \vspace{2em}
    \item Take the natural logarithm of both sides and solve for $u$.
      \vspace{2em}
    \end{subsubproblem}
  \item Now focus on the right hand side of the equation.
    \begin{subsubproblem}
    \item Define a new variable, $v$, by setting $v$ equal to the
      logarithm in the right hand side of the equation.
      \vspace{1em}
    \item Exponentiate both sides of the equation using a clever
      choice for the base so that there will not be any logarithms in
      the equation. Simplify the result.
      \vspace{2em}
    \item Take the natural logarithm of both sides and solve for $v$.
      \vspace{2em}
    \end{subsubproblem}
  \item Substitute your value for $u$ into the left hand side and the
    value for $v$ into the right hand side.

  function that gives the number of individuals in the population for
  a given time.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Express the given information in function form. (Assume the
    population is given by $P(t)$.)
    \vfill
  \item The assumption is that the population is modeled as an

    amount is given by $C(t)$.)
