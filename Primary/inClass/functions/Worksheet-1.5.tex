\noindent \textbf{Instructions:}  Work together in groups of  3 or 4 to complete the following problems.




\begin{enumerate}

\item A small business makes cookies and sells them at the farmer's market.  The fixed monthly cost for use of a Health Department-approved kitchen and rental space at the farmer's market is \$790.  The cost of labor, taxes, and ingredients for the cookies amounts to \$0.24 per cookie, and the cookies sell for \$6.00 per dozen.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a linear cost function representing the cost $C(x)$ to produce $x$ dozen cookies per month.  Then determine the monthly cost to produce 100 dozen cookies each month.
\vfill
\item Write a linear revenue function representing the revenue $R(x)$ for selling $x$ dozen cookies.  Then determine the revenue for for selling 100 dozen cookies.
\vfill
\item Will the business make a profit or lose money if they sell 100 dozen cookies each month?
\vfill
\item Write a linear profit function representing the profit $P(x)$ for producing and selling $x$ dozen cookies in a month. (Profit is revenue minus cost.)
\vfill
\item Determine the least number of cookies (in dozens) that must be produced and sold for a monthly profit.  Your answer should be an appropriate whole number.
\vfill
\item If 150 dozen cookies are sold in a given month, how much money will the business make or lose?
\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\item The boiling point of water is 212$^\circ$ Fahrenheit and 100$^\circ$ Celsius. The freezing point of water
 is 32$^\circ$ Fahrenheit and 0$^\circ$ Celsius. Fahrenheit and Celsius are linearly related.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Determine a function that will tell you the temperature in degrees Celsius if
you already know the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
\vfill
\vfill
 \item If it is 83$^\circ$ Fahrenheit, determine the temperature in degrees Celsius.
 \end{enumerate}

 \item A car has a 15-gal tank for gasoline and gets 30 mpg on a highway while driving 60 mph. Suppose that the driver starts a trip with a full tank of gas and travels 450 mi on the highway at an average speed of 60 mph.
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Write a linear model representing the amount of gas $G(t)$ left in the tank t hours into the trip.
 \vfill
 \vfill
 \item Evaluate $G(4.5)$ and interpret the meaning in the context of the problem.
 \vfill
 \end{enumerate}

\item The table gives the number of calories and the amount of cholesterol for selected fast food hamburgers.\\
\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the data points (480,60) and (720,90) to write a linear function that defines the amount of cholesteral $c(x)$ as a linear function of the number of calories $x$.
\vfill
\item Interpret the meaning of the slope in the context of this problem.
\vfill
\item Use the model from part (a) to predict the amount of cholesterol for a hamburger with 650 calories.
