Student goals:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Plot points in the coordinate plane.
  \item Identify the four quandrants of the coordinate plane.
  \item Calculate the distance between two points.
  \item Make rough sketch of the graph of a function by plotting
    points first.
  \item Determine the $x$ and $y$ intercepts of a function
    analytically and graphically.
  \end{itemize}


\noindent \textbf{Instructions:}  Work together in groups of  3 or 4 to complete the following problems.


\begin{enumerate}

\item Mark the points $P_1(-2,-4.5)$ and $P_2(4,1.5)$ on the
  coordinate plane below. Determine the distance between the two
  points.  Include a sketch of a right triangle whose hypotenuse
  represents the distance between the two points. Label the lengths of
  each side of the right triangle, and for each point state which
  quadrant it lies in.

\item Each of the questions below refers to the equation
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    y & = & |x-2| + h,

  \sideNote{Assume a point is $x$-intercept and then ask what it
    implies about the resulting equation.}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose you know that the graph of the equation has two
    $x$-intercepts. What does this imply about the possible values
    that $h$ could be?
    \vfill
  \item Suppose, instead, you know that the graph of the equation has
    one $x$-intercept. What does this imply about the possible values
    that $h$ could be?
    \vfill
  \item Suppose, instead, you know that the graph of the equation has no
    $x$-intercept. What does this imply about the possible values
    that $h$ could be?
    \vfill

\item Determine all points lying on the $y$-axis that are 5 units away
  from the point $(4,-2)$.  Use the problem solving process stated
  below, and explicitly identify which part of the process you are
  using in each of your steps.  As a group, write your complete
  solution on the board.
