\preClass{Coordinate Systems}



\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 4.1 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. \


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Convert the following angles measured in degrees to radian measure.  Your answers must be written as fractions and not rounded decimals.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\theta=60^\circ$\vfill
\item $\beta=110^\circ$\vfill

\end{enumerate}

\item  Find one positive angle and one negative angle that is coterminal to $\displaystyle \theta=\frac{3}{2}\pi$.\vfill

\item Answer the following questions about a circle that has radius 7 and an angle $\theta$ that subtends an arc of length 15.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine $\theta$ in radians and degrees.\vfill
\item Determine the area of the circular sector with central angle $\theta$ found in part $(a)$.\vfill
\end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}
