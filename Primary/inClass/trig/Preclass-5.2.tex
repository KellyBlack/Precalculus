\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 5.2 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit.


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Evaluate the following using a sum or difference identity and the unit circle.
$$\cos(165^\circ)$$

\vfill

\item  Find the exact value of $\cos (\alpha - \beta)$ given that $\sin \alpha = -\frac{4}{5}$ and $\cos \beta = -\frac{5}{8}$ for $\alpha$ in Quadrant III and $\beta$ in Quadrant II.

\item  Find the exact value of the following.  $$\cos \left( \arcsin \left(-\frac{12}{37}\right)+\arctan \left(\frac{5}{12}\right)\right)$$
\vfill

\end{enumerate}
