first one is done as an example. Recall what it means to FOIL an
expression.

\item A circle is circumscribed within a square so it just touches on
  each of the four edges of the square.
  \begin{subproblem}
    \item Make a sketch of the square and circle. Mark the length of
      the square and the radius of the circle.
    \item Determine the relationships between the length of the edge,
      the radius of the circle, the area of the square, and the area
      of the circle.
    \item Determine the area of the square not covered by the circle
      as a function of the length of one side of the square.
    \item Make a sketch of a graph of the area of the square not
      covered by the circle. The horizontal axis should be the length
      of one side of the square, and the vertical axis should be the
      area. Label your axes.
    \item How does the area change as the length of one side of the
      square increases? (Does it change linearly, does the rate of
      change increase or decrease?)
    \item Determine the proportion of the area not covered by the
      circle with respect to the area of the square. What percentage
      of the area of the square is not covered? How does this change
      as the length of one side of the square changes?
