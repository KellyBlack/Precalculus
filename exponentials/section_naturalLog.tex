\item A computer virus is constructed that will infect two new
  computer systems each day and then wipe the disk drive of its
  current computer clean.  The virus is installed on one computer on
  day 0 (zero).
  \begin{subproblem}
    \item Determine the formula that gives the number of computers
      infected on the number of days since the first computer is
      infected.
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        \mathrm{Number(t)} & = &

    \item Make a rough sketch of the number of new computers infected
      as a function of time.

  there is 0.2g of radon 222 in a basement. Assume that no more
  radon enters the basement after a treatment is applied, and the area
  is not ventilated.

    \item Determine a formula for the amount of radon in the basement
      at a given time, in days, from when the treatment is applied.

\propertiesTitle{Properties of logarithms}

Logarithmic functions satisfy the algebraic properties given below. In
each example it is assumed that $a$, $b$, and $r$ are constants. 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ln(a\cdot b) & = & \ln(a) + \ln(b) \\ [10pt]
  \ln\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) & = & \ln(a) - \ln(b) \\  [10pt]
  \ln\left(a^r\right) & = & r \ln(a) \\ [30pt]
  \log_{10}(a\cdot b) & = & \log_{10}(a) + \log_{10}(b) \\ [10pt]
  \log_{10}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) & = & \log_{10}(a) - \log_{10}(b) \\  [10pt]
  \log_{10}\left(a^r\right) & = & r \log_{10}(a)
\end{eqnarray}
