\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 1.5 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. \\



\begin{enumerate}
\item A sales person makes a base salary of \$350 per week plus 15\% commission on sales.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a linear function to model the sales person's weekly salary $S(x)$ for $x$ dollars in sales.\vfill
\item Evaluate $S(700)$ and interpret the meaning in the context of this problem.
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
\item A town's population has been growing linearly. In 2004 the population was 6,200. By 2009 the population had grown to 8,100. Assume this trend continues.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the points $(0,6200)$ and $(5,8100)$ to write a linear model for this data.
\vfill
\item Interpret the meaning of the slope in this context.
\end{enumerate}
