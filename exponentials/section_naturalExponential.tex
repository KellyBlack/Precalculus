\begin{problem}
\item A bank manager is considering the impact of different terms for
  an account that offers compounded interest. She assumes that the
  interest rate is a constant annual one percent rate and then checks
  to see what happens for different lengths of time between
  compounding. Assume that one dollar is initially deposited.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Determine the amount of money in the account after one hundred
    years, if the interest is compounded yearly.  \vfill
  \item Determine the amount of money in the account after 100 years,
    if the interest is compounded once every six months.  \vfill
  \item Determine the amount of money in the account after 100 years,
    if the interest is compounded once a month.
    \vfill
  \item Determine the amount of money in the account after 100 years,
    if the interest is compounded once a day.
    \vfill
  \item Determine the amount of money in the account after 100 years,
    if the interest is compounded twice  a day.
    \vfill    
  \item What is happening to the balance as the number of terms
    increases?
    \vfill

\item Generalize the value found on the previous page.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Determine a formula for the balance for 1\% annual interest
    after 100 years if the interest is compounded $n$ times per year.
    \vfill
  \item Make a substitution, $u=100n$, in the previous
    expression. Write out the expression for the balance as a function
    of $u$.
    \sideNote{You can solve the substitution for $n$ if you are not
      sure how to do proceed.}
    \vfill
  \item Determine the values of the balance for the following values
    of $u$.

    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
      $u$ & balance \\ \hline
      1    &  \\ \hline
      2    &  \\ \hline
      12   &  \\ \hline
      365  &  \\ \hline
      1000 &  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

  \item What is the value approaching as $u$ gets large? This is a
    number that occurs in many situations, and we do not want to write
    it out every time we use it, so we use the symbol $e$ as a form of
    short hand notation.
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      e & \approx & 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
  \end{subproblem}

  \clearpage

\item When interest is compounded continuously, the balance is
  determined using the function
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathrm{Balance}(t) & = & P e^{rt},
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $P$ is the initial balance, $r$ is the annual interest rate,
  and $t$ is the time in years.

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Sketch a plot of the balance over time if 1\$ is deposited with a
    rate of 1\%.
    \sideNote{Label your axes and annotate your plot.}

    \vfill

  \item What happens to the balance as time increases?

    \vspace{3em}

  \item What would happen to the graph if you make $r$ bigger? What if
    $r$ is smaller?

    \vspace{3em}
  \end{subproblem}
\clearpage

\item As radioactive isotopes decay, the amount of isotope in a sample
  decreases. If the decay rate of an isotope is $r$ then the amount of
  an isotope in a sample is expressed using the function
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathrm{Amount}(t) & = & A e^{-rt},
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $t$ is measured in years.

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item What is the physical interpretation of the constant $A$?
    \vspace{2em}

  \item If a sample of a radioactive substance initially contains 3
    grams, and the radioactive decay is 0.00004, sketch a plot of the
    amount of the substance in the sample over time.
    \sideNote{Label your axes and annotate your plot. Your plot does
      not have to be perfect. Just try to get the general shape.}
    
    \vfill

  \item What happens to the amount of the radioactive substance in the
    sample as time increases?
    
    \vspace{3em}

  \item What would happen to the graph if you make $r$ bigger? What if
    $r$ is smaller?

    \vspace{3em}

\item Simplify each of the following expressions.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item ${\displaystyle \left(e^{4.22}\right)^3}$
    \vfill
  \item ${\displaystyle e^{3.2}\cdot e^{1.8}}$
    \vfill
  \item ${\displaystyle e^{9.33}\cdot e^{t}}$
    \vfill
  \item ${\displaystyle \left(e^{4.19}\cdot e^{2t}\right)^2}$

    \vfill
  \item ${\displaystyle \left(e^r\right)^t = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^t}$

\item The natural exponential function, $e^x$, is a one-to-one
  function, and it must have an inverse. Before we explore the
  function, we examine an important property of the function. The
  function is called the natural logarithm, $\ln(x)$.  In particular
  we want to examine ways to write the expression $e^a\cdot e^b$. For
  each question below, solve the relationships as requested.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Use the properties of the exponential to represent the product
    $e^a\cdot e^b$ as $e$ raised to a single exponential.
    \sideNote{Write the result as $e^a\cdot e^b=e^{\#}$ }
    \label{subprob:exponentialExpansion}
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \label{eqn:exponentialExpansion}
      e^a \cdot e^b & = & 
    \end{eqnarray}
    
  \item If $e^a=x$ substitute this value for $e^a$ into the left hand
    side of equation (\ref{eqn:exponentialExpansion}) above.
    
    \vspace{4em}
    
  \item If $e^b=y$ substitute this value for $e^b$ into the left hand
    side of your previous expression above.
    
    \vspace{4em}
    
  \item Take the natural logarithm of both sides of 
    the previous expression and simplify the expression.
    
    \vfill
    
  \item Solve $e^a=x$ for $a$ and solve $e^b=y$ for $b$ in the
    previous expression and substitute the result into the expression
    from above.
    
    \vfill
    
  \item What does this imply about the expression 
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \ln\lp x \cdot y \rp & = & \hspace{10em}.
    \end{eqnarray*}
  \end{subproblem}

  \clearpage

\item We now examine another property of the inverse of the natural
  exponential, $e^x$. Recall that the inverse is denoted $\ln(x)$. In
  particular we look at the logarithm of $x^r$ where $r$ is a
  constant.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item We can use the algebraic rule $x^r=\lp x \rp^r$. Substitute
    the identity $x=e^{\ln(x)}$ to rewrite the right side of the
    expression: \sideNote{Write the result as $x^r=\left({\#}\right)^r$ }
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \label{eqn:exponentialMultiplication}
      x^r & = & 
    \end{eqnarray}

    
    \item Expand and simplify the exponent in the right hand side of
      the expression.
      \vfill
    \item Take the logarithm of both sides of the expression. Do not
      simplify the left hand side of the expression, but simplify the
      right hand side of the expression.
      \vfill
    \item What does this imply about the expression
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \ln\lp x^r \rp & = & \hspace{10em}.
    \end{eqnarray*}

\item The average rate of change for a function from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is
  defined to be 
  \begin{eqnarray*}

      Number Bacteria &&&&&  \\ [12pt] \hline
      Avg Rate Change &&&&&
    \end{tabular}

    What number is the average rate of change approaching as $b$ gets
    close to zero?

  \item Determine a value so that if a population multiplies its
    population by that number every hour the average rate of change
    approaches 1 from $a=0$ and $b$ gets close to zero.
