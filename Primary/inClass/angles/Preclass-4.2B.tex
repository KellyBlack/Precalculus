\preClass{Coordinate Systems}



\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 4.2B and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Evaluate the functions if possible.  Your answers must be exact and not decimal approximations.

\begin{enumerate}

\item $\sin(0)=$\vfill
\item $\cot(\pi)=$\vfill
\item $\tan(3\pi)=$\vfill
\item $\sec(\pi)=$\vfill
\item $\csc(0)=$\vfill
\item $\cos(\pi)=$\vfill
\end{enumerate}




\newpage


\item  Given $ \displaystyle \cos(t)=\frac{7}{25}$ for $\displaystyle \frac{3\pi}{2}<t<2\pi$.  Use an appropriate Pythagorean Identity to find the value of $\sin(t)$.\vfill

\item  Circle all properties that apply to $\csc(t)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The function is even.
\item The function is odd.
\item The period is $2\pi$.
\item The period is $\pi$.
\item The domain is all real numbers.
\item The domain is all real numbers excluding odd multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
\item The domain is all real numbers excluding multiples of $\pi$.
\end{enumerate}



\end{enumerate}
