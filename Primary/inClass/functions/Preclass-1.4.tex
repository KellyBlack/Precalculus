\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine a \emph{point-slope} equation for a line through the
  points $(-5,2)$ and $(6,-3)$.

  \vfill
  
\item Write the \emph{slope-intercept} equation for a line through the
  point $(2,3)$ that is perpendicular to the line $2x+4y-7=0$.

\vfill

\item Given the function defined $f(x)=x^2+3$, determine the average
  rate of change of $f(x)$ from $x_1=2$ to $x_2=4$.

\item The equation for a linear function is given by:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    D(x) & = & m(x-2)+4,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $m$ is a constant. Answer each question below and provide
  a brief justification for your answer.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For what values of $m$ is $D(x)$ an increasing function?
    \vfill
  \item For what values of $m$ is $D(x)$ a decreasing function?
    \vfill
  \item What values of $m$ will ensure that $D(3)>5$?
    \vfill
  \item If you are given that the value of $D(x)$ increases by 3 as
    $x$ increases by 6, what is the value of $m$?
