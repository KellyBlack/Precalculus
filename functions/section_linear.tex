\begin{problem}
\item A tortoise and a hare move in a straight line, and the both
  start at $x=0$. The tortoise's position is given by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    x_T & = & \frac{1}{2} t,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $t$ is in minutes and $x$ is in meters.  The hare's position
  is given by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    x_H & = & 2 t,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $t$ is in minutes and $x$ is in meters.

  Determine the relationship between the hare's and the tortoise's
  position. That is, given the hare's position determine the
  tortoise's position. Make a sketch of the plot of the relationship using the axes below.

\item In each case below determine the formulas for the lines that
  satisfy the given requirements. In each case make a rough sketch of
  the line.

  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Goes through the point $P(-2,5)$ and has a slope of -3.
    \vfill
  \item Goes through the points $P_1(-3,-4)$ and $P_2(4,1)$.

\item Birds near a park are studied by a group of researchers. The
  birds tend to use cigarette butts in their nests. It is estimated
  that the number of cigarette butts used for nesting materials varies
  linearly with the distance from the nest to a nearby open air
  theater. A nest that is a distance of 30 meters appears to have 10
  cigarette butts, and a nest that is a distance of 40 meters appears
  to have 8 cigarette butts. 
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Determine the relationship that will predict the number of
    cigarette butts in a nest given its distance from the theater.
    Use it to predict the number of cigarette butts in a nest 50
    meters from the theater. Also, make a sketch of the relationship.

  \item A nest is found that has 4 cigarette butts. What is the
    prediction for the distance the nest is from the theater.
