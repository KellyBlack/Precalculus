\begin{problem}
\item A chemical reaction has a reactant that is broken down by
  itself, and the resulting reaction produces two different
  products. It is estimated that for each gram of the reactant that
  $\frac{1}{3}$g of the first product is produced and $\frac{1}{6}$g
  of the original reactant remains. Everything else that remains is
  the second product.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item If you start with four grams of reactant how many grams of the
    products and the reactants will you get?
    \vfill
  \item Determine the number of grams of the products and reactants
    will result when you start with  $x$ grams of reactant.

\begin{problem}

\item The time required to bake ceramics depends on the mass of the
  ceramic. It is estimated to be a linear relationship between the
  time and mass. \textbf{The goal is to determine the time required to
    bake a ceramic sample given its mass.}
  \begin{subproblem}
    \item Should there be a positive or negative slope for the
      relationship? Briefly justify your answer.
      \vspace{2em}

    \item With respect to the costs, would you prefer a larger or
      smaller slope for the relationship? Briefly justify your answer.
      \vspace{2em}

    \item Samples are run, and it is estimated that the baking time
      for a ceramic whose mass is 2,000g is five hours. It is
      estimated that the baking time for a ceramic whose mass is
      3,000g is five and a half hours. Determine the baking time given
      the mass.
      \vfill
      \vfill

    \item A sample ceramic will be tested, and its mass is
      4,500g. How long would you expect it to take to bake the
      ceramic?

\item Alice was born on the same day as her father, Bob. This year
  Bob's age is three times Alice's age. In fifteen years, Bob will be
  twice his daughter's age. What are their ages this year?
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Let Alice's age this year be denoted as $A$, and let Bob's age
    this year be denoted as $B$. Write the algebraic expression that
    indicates that Bob's age is three times Alice's age.  
    \label{question:aliceBobCurrentAge}
    \vspace{2em}
  \item If Alice's age is now $A$ what will her age be in fifteen
    years?  
    \vspace{2em}
  \item If Bob's age is now $B$ what will his age be in fifteen years?
    \vspace{2em}
  \item Use the two previous expressions, and write out the algebraic
    expression that indicates that Bob's future age will be twice
    Alice's future age.
    \label{question:aliceBobFutureAge}
    \vspace{2em}
  \item Use the two expressions from parts
    \ref{question:aliceBobCurrentAge} and \ref{question:aliceBobFutureAge} 
    to draw a sketch of the two linear relationships. Assume that
    Bob's age is a function of Alice's age, and the horizontal axis
    will Alice's age. Will the system have a solution that makes
    sense? 
    \vfill

  \item Use the two expressions from parts
    \ref{question:aliceBobCurrentAge} and \ref{question:aliceBobFutureAge} 
    to determine Alice's and Bob's age.

\item Trucks are unloaded at a warehouse, and during the summer it is
  estimated that it takes longer to unload a truck if the weather is
  warmer. When the temperature is 22C it is estimated that it takes
  sixty minutes to unload a truck. For each increase of one degree
  Celsius it is estimated to take four additional minutes to unload a
  truck.
  \begin{subproblem}
    \item How long will it take to unload a truck if the temperature
      is 23C?
      \vspace{2em}
    \item How long will it take to unload a truck if the temperature
      is 24C?
      \vspace{2em}
    \item How long will it take to unload a truck given a temperature
      of T degrees Celsius?
      \vfill
  \end{subproblem}

  \clearpage

\item In the previous problem it was assumed that the truck was being
  unloaded during the summer. In the winter the relationship between
  unloading time and the temperature is different. When the
  temperature is 5C it is estimated that it takes fifty minutes to
  unload a truck, and for each decrease on one degree Celsius it is
  estimated to take three additional minutes to unload the truck.
  \begin{subproblem}
    \item Determine how long it will take to unload the truck for any
      temperature less than 5C.
      \vfill
    \item At what temperature should you switch from using the
      formula on the previous problem to using the formula above?
      \vfill
      \vfill
    \item Write out the formula to determine the time required to
      unload the truck given \textbf{any} temperature in Celsius.
      \vspace{3em}
    \item What is the shortest time to unload a time and what is the
      best temperature to unload a truck?
