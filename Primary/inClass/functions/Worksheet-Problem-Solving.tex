\noindent \textbf{Instructions:}  Work together in groups of  3 or 4 to complete the following problems.


\begin{enumerate}



\item The value of a newly purchased equipment is a linear function of time. A company purchases a piece of equipment for \$40,000. After 5 years, the equipment loses 15\% of its value. Answer the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the value of the equipment after 5 years.
\item Express the value V (in dollars) of the equipment as a function of time t (in years) since purchase.
\item Determine the total time (in years) it will take for the machine to be worth 45\% of its original value.
\end{enumerate}

\item Give the coordinates of all of the points that lie on \emph{both} the parabola $y=x^2+1$ \emph{and} the line $y=2x+4$.  Use the following steps to answer the question.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How can one describe an arbitrary point on the line $y=2x+4$ as an ordered pair?
		\item How can one describe an arbitrary point on the line $y=x^2+1$ as an ordered pair?
		\item How do these descriptions help you find the intersection.
	\end{enumerate}

\item You have 50 cm of wire, and you have to use part of this wire to
make a rectangle that's twice as long as it is wide, and the rest of the wire (if there
is any left) to make a square.
What should the dimensions of the shapes be if you want the total area to be as
small as possible?

\item Find the point $(x,y)$ lying on the parabola $y = x^2 + 2x + 1$ so that the average rate of change on the interval between $x$ and $2$ is zero.

	$$[-2,1]\cup(2,3]\cup\{5\}$$
	and whose range is
	$$[-6,-4)\cup[-1,1]\cup\{2\}\cup(3,4].$$

\item A business forms a model of its widget sales via a pricing function $p(x) = 400-\frac{70}{8}x$. Here, $x$ is the number of widgets sold and $p(x)$ is the sales price in dollars per widget.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the revenue function $R(x)$ for this business (revenue is total sales). 
\item Find the number $x$ sold that will maximize revenue. (This will be an unrealistic fraction,
but do not round.)
\item What is the maximum revenue? 
\item What is the price $p(x)$ that yields maximum revenue?
\end{enumerate}

%\item A small business makes scarves and sells them at the farmer's market.  The fixed monthly cost for the rental space at the farmer's market is \$200.  The cost of labor and supplies for the scarves amounts to \$7 per scarf, which are sold for \$35 each at the market.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Write a linear functions for the cost $C(x)$, revenue $R(x)$, and profit $P(x)$ corresponding to the production/sale of $x$ scarves per month.
%\vfill
%\item Determine the cost, revenue, and profit associated with selling 15 scarves in one month. Will the business make a profit or lose money that month?
%\vfill
%\item Determine the least number of scarves that must be produced and sold for a monthly profit.  Your answer should be an appropriate whole number.

%\item A diverter at the end of a gutter spout is meant to direct water away from a house.  The homeowner makes the diverter from a rectangular piece of aluminum that is 20 inches long and 12 inches wide.  She makes two folds both parallel to the 20 inch side.  Each fold is a distance \(x\) inches away from the edge.  
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Write the volume of water that can be carried through the diverter as a function of \(x\).
%\item What is the maximum volume of water that can be carried through the diverter?
