\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 3.5B and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item  Solve the following equations.  Then check your answers.  Leave your answers as symbolic expressions (no decimals).
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\displaystyle 5\log_6(7w+1)=10$
\vfill
\item $2\log_8(3y-5)+20=24$
\vfill


\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item If \$10,000 is invested in an account earning 5.5\% interest compounded continuously, determine how long it will take for the money to triple.  Round your final answer to the nearest year.




\end{enumerate}
