\noindent Watch the Pre-Class videos for Section 3.4 and answer the following questions. Remember that in your written work you are graded on the correctness of your supporting work and not just your final answer. Always give an exact answer unless you are explicitly told to round; calculator approximations will not receive full credit. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Use logarithmic properties to simplify and condense the following into one logarithm.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\ln(x)+\ln(y)-\ln(z)$
\vfill
\item $\displaystyle \log_2(x^2)+\frac{1}{2}\log_2(x-1)-3\log_2((x+3)^2)$
\vfill

\end{enumerate}


\item Use logarithmic properties to expand each expression.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\displaystyle \log_2\Big(\frac{x}{y^5}\Big)$
\vfill
\item $\displaystyle \ln \Big((y^2-16)(y+8)^2  \Big)$
\vfill

\end{enumerate}

\item (Use the change of base formula to approximate $\log_{7.5}(98)$ and round your answer to 4 decimal places.  Show all work.

\end{enumerate}
