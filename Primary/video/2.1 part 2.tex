\subsection{Solve Applications Involving Quadratic Functions}


\begin{enumerate}
\item A leaping cat follows a parabolic path. The cat jumps a maximum height of 5 feet and covers 6 feet of horizontal ground distance. Find an equation of the form $y = a(x-h)^2+k$ which represents the path of the cat. \vfill

\item An object is projected vertically upward from the top of a building with an initial velocity of 112 ft/sec. Its distance $s(t)$ in feet above the ground after $t$ seconds is given by the equation $s(t)=-16t^2 + 112t + 110.$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find its maximum distance above the ground.
\item Find the height of the building.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Applying a Quadratic Function to Geometry}


\item A parking area is to be constructed adjacent to a road.  The developer has purchased 340 ft of fencing.  Determine dimensions for the parking lot that would maximize the area.  Then find the maximum area.
