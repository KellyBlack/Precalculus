\begin{problem}
\item Two populations of different species of bacteria interact. The
  number of bacteria (in millions) in the first population is given by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    B(t) & = & 10 + t^2,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $t$ is the time in days since the beginning of the year.  The
  number of bacteria (in millions) in the second population is given by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    C(t) & = & 10+(t-2)^2,
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $t$ is the time in days since the beginning of the year.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Make a sketch of the two functions below.
    \vfill
  \item A researcher decides to alter the situation and adds 5 million
    bacteria to the first population given by $B(t)$. Determine a
    formula for the altered population. Make a sketch of the original
    and altered populations below.

\begin{problem}
\item The height, in meters, of a certain tree changes by the
  relationship
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    h(t) & = & \sqrt{\frac{t}{3}},
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $t$ is the time in years from when the seed was germinated. 
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Make a sketch of the height of a tree as a function of time.
    \vfill
  \item Two seeds are planted, and the second seed germinates one year
    after the first is germinated. Determine the formulas for the
    height of the two trees with respect to the time that the first
    seed is germinated. Make a sketch of the two functions on the same
    graph.
    \vfill
  \item A new strain of the tree is developed that grows twice as fast
    as the original. Determine the formula that will give the height
    of the new strain. Make a sketch comparing the height of the
    original and the new strains.

\item A function is defined to be
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    f(x) & = & |x|.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Make a sketch of the function on the axes below.
  \item Make a sketch of the following new functions on the graph as
    well with clear annotations:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      g(x) & = & f(3x), \\
      h(x) & = & f(x)+2, \\
      p(x) & = & f(x+2), \\
      q(x) & = & 3f(x).
