\subsection{Applying the Point-Slope Formula} ~

  {
    The \underline{point-slope equation} for the line through the
    point $(x_1,y_1)$ with slope $m$ is $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$.
  }
}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the point-slope formula to find an equation of the line
  passing through the point $(2,-3)$ and having slope -4.  Write your
  answer in slope-intercept form.

\vfill

\item Use the point-slope formula to write an equation of the line
  passing through the points $(4,-6)$ and $(-1,2)$.  Write your answer
  in slope-intercept form.

\subsection{Create Linear Functions to Model Data}
In many day-to-day applications, two variables are related linearly.
This means that any given any change in an independent variable, $x$,
will always produce a corresponding change in the dependent variable,
$y$.  And when you plot this relationship on a graph, it traces a
straight line.

\item A family plan for a cell phone has a monthly base price of \$99
  plus \$12.99 for each additional family member added beyond the
  primary account holder.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a linear function to model the monthly cost $C(x)$, in
  dollars, of a family plan for $x$ additional family members added.
  \vfill
\item Evaluate $C(4)$ and interpret the meaning in the context of this
  problem.

\item The data given in the table represent the age and systolic blood
  pressure for a sample of 12 randomly selected healthy adults.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $x$ represents the age of an adult, in years, and $y$
  represents the systolic blood pressure, in mmHG.  Use the points
  $(21, 118)$ and $(51, 130)$ to write a linear model relating $y$ as
  a function of $x$.
  \vfill
\item Interpret the meaning of the slope in the context of this problem.\\[.5in]
\item Use the model to estimate the systolic blood pressure for a 55
  year old.  Round to the nearest whole unit.
