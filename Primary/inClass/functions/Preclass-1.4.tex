\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine a \emph{point-slope} equation for a line through the
  points $(-5,2)$ and $(6,-3)$.

  \vfill
  
\item Write the \emph{slope-intercept} equation for a line through the
  point $(2,3)$ that is perpendicular to the line $2x+4y-7=0$.

\vfill

\item Given the function defined $f(x)=x^2+3$, determine the average
  rate of change of $f(x)$ from $x_1=2$ to $x_2=4$.

\item A small animal moves along a wall and starts at a position 3.5
  meters from a corner.  The animal travels 0.3 meters away from the
  corner each minute. Determine the function that provides the
  distance the animal is from the corner given the number of minutes
  from the initial time.

  \vfill

\item A manufacturing facility has 3.5 litres of a material available
  at the start of a given days. The facility produces 0.3 litres of
  material each hour. Determine the function that provides the amount
  of material available given the number of hours from the initial
  time.
