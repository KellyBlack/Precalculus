\begin{problem}
\item A triangle, ABC, has lengths $a=5$, $b=4$, and the angle
  directly across from $c$ is $\gamma=\frac{\pi}{6}$.
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Draw a picture of the triangle.
    \vfill
  \item Label the sides and the angle in your picture.
  \item Determine the area of the triangle. (Hint: draw a vertical
    line that represents the height in your triangle and use the
    appropriate trigonometric functions to determine the height.)

\begin{problem}
\item A surveyor sets up a transit 2m above the surface of the
  ground. It is 80m away from a building. The transit is pointing at
  the top of the building, and its angle of elevation is 35
  degrees. How tall is the building?
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item Make a sketch of the situation. (It may take a couple tries!)
    \vfill
  \item Indicate and label all of the information that is given and
    indicate any variables that are not known in your diagram above.
  \item Identify the relationships between the variables.

\item Chris Hadfield is in the International Space Station and is
  360km above the surface of the earth. He looks down toward the
  center of the earth and then to the horizon of the earth. He
  measures an angle of 71 degrees between the two directions. What is
  the radius of the earth?
