\begin{enumerate}
\item A sales person makes a base salary of \$350 per week plus 15\% commission on sales.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a linear function to model the sales person's weekly salary $S(x)$ for $x$ dollars in sales.\vfill
\item Evaluate $S(700)$ and interpret the meaning in the context of this problem.
\end{enumerate}

\vfill
\item A town's population has been growing linearly. In 2004 the population was 6,200. By 2009 the population had grown to 8,100. Assume this trend continues.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the points $(0,6200)$ and $(5,8100)$ to write a linear model for this data.
\vfill
\item Interpret the meaning of the slope in this context.
\end{enumerate}
