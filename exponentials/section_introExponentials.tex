\begin{problem}
\item Carbon-15 has a half life of about 2.5 seconds. If an object has
  2 grams of carbon-15 in it now, then in 2.5 seconds it will only
  have 1 gram due to its decay. An object has $8.0\times 10^-{6}$
  grams of carbon-15, and it is placed in a sealed
  container. Determine how much carbon-15 is contained in the object
  at the following times:

\item A species of bacteria is able to divide every three hours. That
  is every three hours each bacteria splits into two new
  individuals. After each division, only 75\% of the remaining
  bacteria survive. A colony starts with 10,000 individuals. Determine
  the number of bacteria at the following times:
  \begin{subproblem}
  \item After 3 hours.

\item A bank offers a savings account in which the interest is
  compounded 1.5\% annually, and the interest is accrued each
  month. If a person places \$1,000 in an account how much money is in
  the account after $n$ months?
  \textit{Determine the amount of money in the account after the
    first, second, and third months. Do not simplify your results, and
  try to find the pattern.}

\item Briefly state two ideas from today's class.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
  \item 
  \end{itemize}
\item A bank offers 1.5\% annual interest compounded weekly (assume 52
  weeks in a year). You will deposit \$5,000 into the account. How
  much money will be in the account at any time?
\item A bank offers 1.5\% annual interest compounded monthly. You will
  deposit some money into an account and wish to have \$25,000 after
  two years. How much money should you deposit?
\item A compound is created that decays over time. It takes four years
  until half of the compound decays in a sample. You wish to store the
  compound for 5 years. How much should you store if you wish to get 4
  kg after the storage period?
